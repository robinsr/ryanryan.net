title: "Desktop Keyboard Shortcut Manager"
startDate: "2022-01"
current: true
description: "A modern Electron desktop application that helps users learn and remember keyboard shortcuts for their workflow applications. The app automatically detects the active window and displays relevant shortcuts, featuring a clean interface with search functionality, keyboard navigation, and export capabilities. Built with a focus on productivity and developer experience."
highlights:
  - "Developed a cross-platform Electron application with automatic active window detection using electron-active-window for seamless workflow integration"
  - "Implemented a sophisticated state management system using MobX and MobX State Tree for complex shortcut data and UI state synchronization"
  - "Built a responsive React-based UI with styled-components, featuring theme support, keyboard navigation, and accessibility considerations"
  - "Created an intelligent search system that allows users to find shortcuts quickly and even create new shortcuts on-the-fly"
  - "Designed a modular component architecture with reusable card-based layouts for displaying shortcut categories and individual shortcuts"
  - "Integrated export functionality for sharing shortcut collections in multiple formats (PNG, SVG) with custom rendering capabilities"
  - "Implemented comprehensive keyboard navigation allowing users to operate the entire application without mouse interaction"
  - "Added multi-application support with automatic switching and always-on-top functionality for optimal workflow integration"
