startDate: "2024-09"
current: true
description: "A sophisticated macOS file browser application built with SwiftUI that provides advanced file organization through a comprehensive tagging system. The app features intelligent file indexing, metadata management, and powerful search capabilities, allowing users to organize and discover files through descriptive tags, attribution metadata, and custom work queues."
highlights:
  - "Built a native macOS application using SwiftUI and AppKit with a modern, responsive interface featuring grid and table views for file browsing"
  - "Implemented a sophisticated tagging system with multiple domains including descriptive tags, attribution metadata (artist, creator, owner), creation dates, and work queues"
  - "Developed a robust file indexing service using GRDB (SQLite) for persistent storage of file metadata, tags, and relationships"
  - "Created an intelligent file identification system using extended attributes to maintain unique content IDs across file operations"
  - "Integrated macOS system services including QuickLook for thumbnail generation, Spotlight for search, and file system monitoring for real-time updates"
  - "Built a comprehensive search system supporting complex queries with tag-based filtering, date ranges, and full-text search capabilities"
  - "Implemented a work queue system for batch operations and task management with visual progress tracking"
  - "Designed a modular architecture with dependency injection using Factory framework for maintainable and testable code"
  - "Added advanced features including drag-and-drop support, keyboard navigation, context menus, and customizable UI panels"
  - "Integrated with macOS system features like clipboard operations, file operations (rename, move, trash), and volume management"
