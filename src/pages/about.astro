						Hi, I'm Ryan.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I'm a software engineer based in Seattle, with a background in full-stack development, platform engineering, and developer tooling. I've spent much of my career building systems that support large-scale applications and the people who operate them — from content rendering engines serving millions of requests per day, to internal tools that make developer lives less painful.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I care deeply about thoughtful systems, human-centered engineering, and team cultures built on trust. I've worked in high-velocity environments, led technical projects across international teams, and spent a lot of time fixing things that weren't built to last. I believe that good engineering isn't just about clever solutions — it's about clarity, maintainability, and doing the invisible work that keeps systems resilient.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						For several years, I worked at Amazon, where I built and scaled merchandising tools, migrated legacy systems to AWS, and helped reduce operational pain for both engineers and customers. Along the way, I picked up a lot of lessons about what breaks at scale, how to debug the real problem (not just the symptom), and why observability is one of the best investments you can make.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						After a personal sabbatical to focus on health and reset my priorities, I returned to engineering with more intention — choosing work that's grounded, impactful, and collaborative. This blog is part of that: a space to reflect on what I've learned, what I'm still figuring out, and how to build better systems (and maybe a better self) along the way.
