    About Ryan
  </h1>
</header>

Hi, I'm Ryan.

I'm a software engineer based in Seattle, with a background in full-stack
development, platform engineering, and developer tooling. I've spent much of
my career building systems that support large-scale applications and the
people who operate them — from content rendering engines serving millions of
requests per day, to internal tools that make developer lives less painful.

I care deeply about **thoughtful systems**, **human-centered engineering**, and team
cultures built on trust. I've worked in high-velocity environments, led
technical projects across international teams, and spent a lot of time fixing
things that weren't built to last. I believe that good engineering isn't just
about clever solutions — it's about clarity, maintainability, and doing the
invisible work that keeps systems resilient.

For several years, I worked at Amazon, where I built and scaled merchandising
tools, migrated legacy systems to AWS, and helped reduce operational pain for
both engineers and customers. Along the way, I picked up a lot of lessons
about what breaks at scale, how to debug the real problem (not just the
symptom), and why observability is one of the best investments you can make.

After a personal sabbatical to focus on health and reset my priorities, I
returned to engineering with more intention — choosing work that's grounded,
impactful, and collaborative. This blog is part of that: a space to reflect
on what I've learned, what I'm still figuring out, and how to build better
systems (and maybe a better self) along the way.
